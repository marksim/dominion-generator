  extra: This is a Treasure card. It is a Kingdom card; it will only be in games where
    itis randomly dealt out as one of the 10 Kingdom cards, or otherwise selected
    tobe one of them. It is played during your Buy phase, like other Treasure cards.When
    you play it, count the number of cards in your deck and discard pilecombined,
    divide by 5, and round down. That is how many coins this producesfor you. Once
    played, the amount of coins you get does not change even if thenumber of cards
    changes later in the turn. The next time you play it, countagain. If you play
    multiple copies, obviously the number will be the same forall of them. It does
    not matter what order your discard pile is in, but the orderyour deck is in matters.
    Do not change that order while counting! You will getto look through your discard

    to his discard pile at end of turn.'
  extra: You are not taking a turn with the deck of the player to your left; that
    player is taking a turn, with youmaking the decisions and gaining the cards. This
    is a crucial difference to keep in mind when consideringcard interactions - the
    "you" in all cards still refers to the player being Possessed, not the player
    doing thePossessing. Possession has several pieces to it:-You can see the Possessed
    player's cards for the entire turn, which means you will see his next hand duringClean-up.
    You will also see any cards he is entitled to see due to card rules; for example,
    you can look atcards he has set aside with Native Village (from Seaside). You
    can count any cards he can count.-Any cards the Possessed player would have gained
    in any way, you gain instead; this includes cardsbought, as well as cards gained
    due to Actions. The cards you gain this way go to your discard pile, even ifthey
    would have gone to that player's hand or the top of his deck or somewhere else.
    You only gain cardshe would have; you do not gain tokens he would have (for example
    from the Seaside card Pirate Ship).-During the Possessed turn, whenever one of
    that player's cards is trashed, set it aside, and that player putsit into his
    discard pile at the end of the turn, after Clean-up. This counts as the card being
    trashed, so, forexample, you could trash a Mining Village (from Intrigue) and
    get the 2 coins. Getting those cards back atend of turn does not count as those
    cards being gained (so for example, you won't get them). Other players'cards that
    are trashed during that turn are not returned.-Cards passed with Masquerade (from
    Intrigue) are not being gained or trashed, and so are passed normally.Cards returned
    to the Supply with Ambassador (from Seaside) are also not being trashed, and so
    return tothe Supply normally.[Continued on blank tab]

  extra: When you play this, you pick an Action card fromthe Supply that costs less
    than it, and treat this card as if it werethe card you chose. Normally this will
    just mean that you followthe instructions on the card you picked. So, if you play
    Band ofMisfits and Fortress is in the Supply, you could pick that and thenyou
    would draw a card and get +2 Actions, since that is whatFortress does when you
    play it. Band of Misfits also gets thechosen card's cost, name, and types. If
    you use Band of Misfits asa card that trashes itself, such as Death Cart, you
    will trash theBand of Misfits (at which point it will just be a Band of Misfitscard
    in the trash). If you use Band of Misfits as a duration card(from Seaside), Band
    of Misfits will stay in play until next turn,just like the duration card would.
    If you use Band of Misfits as aThrone Room (from Dominion), King's Court (from
    Prosperity),or Procession, and use that effect to play a duration card, Band ofMisfits
    will similarly stay in play. If you use Throne Room, King'sCourt, or Procession
    to play a Band of Misfits card multiple times,you only pick what to play it as
    the first time; the other times it isstill copying the same card. For example,
    if you use Procession toplay Band of Misfits twice and choose Fortress the first
    time, youwill automatically replay it as Fortress, then trash the Band ofMisfits,
    return it to your hand (it is a Fortress when it's trashed,and Fortress has a
    when-trashed ability that returns it to yourhand), and gain an Action card costing
    exactly 6 Coins(1 Coin more thanBand of Misfits, which has left play and so is
    no longer copyingFortress). If you use Band of Misfits as a card that does somethingduring
    Clean-up, such as Hermit, it will do that thing duringClean-up. When you play
    Horn of Plenty (from Cornucopia), itcounts Band of Misfits as whatever Band of
    Misfits was played as;for example if you play a Band of Misfits as a Fortress,
    and thenplay another Band of Misfits as a Scavenger, and then play Hornof Plenty,
    you will gain a card costing up to 3 Coins. Band of Misfits canonly be played
    as a card that is visible in the Supply; it cannot beplayed as a card after its
    pile runs out, and cannot be played as anon-Supply card like Mercenary; it can

    Hermit: When you play this, look through your discard pile, and then you may choose
    to trash a card that is not a Treasure, from either your hand or your discard
    pile. You do not have to trash a card and cannot trash Treasures. A card with
    multiple types, one of which is Treasure (such as Harem from Intrigue), is a Treasure.
    After trashing or not, you gain a card costing up to 3 Coins. The card you gain
    comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. Gaining a card is mandatory
    if it is possible. Then, when you discard Hermit from play - normally, in Clean-up,
    after playing it in your Action phase - if you did not buy any cards this turn,
    you trash Hermit and gain a Madman. It does not matter whether or not you gained
    cards other ways, only whether or not you bought a card. If there are no Madman
    cards left, you do not gain one. If Hermit is not discarded from play during Clean-up
    - for example, if you put it on your deck with Scheme (from Hinterlands) - then
    the ability that trashes it will not trigger.'

    When you play it, you get +2 Actions, return it to theMadman pile if you can (this

    three cards. Normally, nothing will prevent you fromreturning Madman to the Madman

    This is a pile in which each card is different. There is the same basic ability
    on each card, but also another ability unique to that card in the pile, and they
    all have different names. Shuffle the Knights pile before playing with it, keeping
    it face down except for the top one, which is the only card that can be gained
    from the pile. See Additional Rules for Dark Ages and Preparation. Follow the
    rules on Knights in order from top to bottom; Sir Michael causes players to discard
    before it trashes cards.'
  extra: The ability Knights have in common is that each other player reveals the
    top 2 cards of his deck, trashes one of them that he chooses that costs from 3
    Coins to 6 Coins, and discards the rest; then, if a Knight was trashed, you trash
    the Knight you played that caused this trashing. Resolve this ability in turn
    order, starting with the player to your left. Cards with Potion in the cost (from
    Alchemy) do not cost from 3 Coins to 6 Coins. The player losing a card only gets
    a choice if both cards revealed cost from 3 Coins to 6 Coins; if they both do
    and one is a Knight but the player picks the other card, that will not cause the
    played Knight to be trashed.When Sir Martin is the top card of the pile, it can
    be gained withan Armory and so on. If Sir Vander is trashed, you gain a Gold;
    thishappens whether it is trashed on your turn or someone else's. Theplayer who
    had Sir Vander is the one who gains the Gold,regardless of who played the card
    that trashed it. The Gold fromSir Vander, and the card gained for Dame Natalie,

    you may choose to trash zero, one, ortwo cards from your hand. Dame Josephine
    is also a Victory card,worth 2 Victory at the end of the game. The Knight pile
    is not a Victorypile though, and does not get a counter for Trade Route (fromProsperity)
    even if Dame Josephine starts on top. If you choose touse the Knights with Black
    Market (a promotional card), put aKnight directly into the Black Market deck,
    rather than using therandomizer card. Sir Martin only costs 4 Coins, though the

  extra: 'When you play this, trash a card from your hand,and gain two cards, each
    costing less than the card you trashed.Trashing a card is not optional. If you
    do not have any cards left inyour hand to trash, you do not gain any cards. The
    two cards yougain can be different or the same. For example you could trash aGold
    to gain a Duchy and a Silver. Gaining cards is not optional ifyou trashed a card.
    The gained cards come from the Supply and areput into your discard pile; if there
    are no cheaper cards in theSupply (for example if you trash a Copper), you do
    not gain any.If there is only one card in the Supply cheaper than the trashedcard,
    you gain that one. The cards you gain are gained one at atime; this may matter
    with cards that do something when gained,such as Inn from Dominion: Hinterlands.
    When you buy this, youmay choose to overpay for it. If you do, you gain two Action
    cardseach costing exactly the amount you overpaid. The Action cardscan be different
    or the same. For example, if you buy Stonemasonfor 6 Coins, you could gain two
    Heralds. The Action cards come fromthe Supply and are put into your discard pile.
    If there are no cardswith the appropriate cost in the Supply, you do not gain
    one.Overpaying with a Potion (from Dominion: Alchemy) will let yougain cards with
    Potion in the cost. Cards with multiple types, oneof which is Action (such as
    Great Hall from Dominion: Intrigue),are Action cards. If you choose not to overpay,

    could agree to use one of every Kingdom card you own that is not a part of the
    Supply). It is recommended that the Black Market deck contain at least 15 Kingdom
    cards, with no duplicates. All players can see which cards are placed in the Black
    Market deck before the game begins, at which point the deck is shuffled. This
    deck is not a Supply pile and if it is emptied, it does not count towardsthe end

  extra: A player with no cards left in his deck shuffles first inorder to get a card
    to discard. If he still has no cards,he doesn't discard one. A player discarding
    his lastcard to this has the gained Curse become the onlycard in his deck. If
    there aren't enough Curses left togo around, deal them out in turn order, starting

    on his last turn.'
  extra: This looks at the most recent turn of the player to your right,even if you've
    taken multiple turns in a row. If that playergained no cards, or nothing costing
    6 or less, then Smugglersdoes nothing. If that player gained multiple cards costing
    6 orless, you choose which one to gain a copy of. Gained cardsmust come from the
    supply. They can be any card gained,whether bought or otherwise gained; you can
    even gain a cardthat the previous player gained with Smugglers. If the previousplayer
    gained a card via Black Market, you will not be able togain a copy of it (no copies
    of it in the supply.) Thisis not an Attack; Lighthouse and Moat can't stop it.
    Youcannot gain cards with Potion in the cost with Smugglers.

  extra: You wait until the start of your next turn to draw the 5extra cards; you
    don't draw them at the end of the turn youplayed Tactician. Tactician stays out
    in front of you untilthe Clean-up phase of your next turn. Because you mustdiscard
    at least one card in order to gain the bonuses fromtactician, it is not possible
    to Throne Room a Tactician toget +10 cards, +2 Buys, and +2 Actions. You will
    have todiscard all of your cards with the first Tactician and youwill not have
    cards left in your hand to trigger the carddrawing or the extra Buy or the extra
    Action when youplay Tactician for the second time.

    Trash this and another copy of Treasure Map from your hand. If you do trash two
    Treasure Maps, gain 4 Gold cards, putting them on top of your deck.'
  extra: You can play this without another Treasure Map in yourhand; if you do, you
    trash this and gain nothing. Youhave to actually trash two copies of Treasure
    Map to gainthe Golds; so for example if you Throne Room a TreasureMap, with two
    more Treasure Maps in hand, then the firsttime Treasure Map resolves you trash
    it and another oneand gain 4 Golds, and the second time it resolves youtrash your
    other Treasure Map but gain nothing (since youdidn't actually trash the played
    Treasure Map that time).If there aren't enough Gold cards left, just gain what
    youcan. The gained Golds go on top of your Deck. If yourdeck was empty they become
    the only cards in it.

  extra: If you buy multiple cards and at least one of them is aVictory card, then
    none of your Treasuries can be put ontop of your deck. If you played multiple
    Treasuries anddid not buy a Victory card this turn, then you can putany or all
    of the played Treasuries on top of your deck.If you forget and discard a Treasury
    to your discard pile,then essentially you have chosen not to use the optionalability.
    You may not dig through your discard pile toretrieve it later. Gaining a Victory
    card without buyingit, such as with Smugglers, does not stop you fromputting Treasury
    on top of your deck.
